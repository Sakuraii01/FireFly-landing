                  and Mechanical Engineering at several prestigious institutions. Involved in path breaking research in carbon emission 
                  reductions through biodiversity conservation, aerodynamic drag reduction mechanisms for aircraft and adoption of clean 
                  energy such as green hydrogen. Proficient in experimental and computational aerodynamics through wind tunnel testing and CFD. 
                  Passionate about our environment and looking to develop sustainable solutions to reduce emissions including green buildings, 
                  renewable energy sources, eco-friendly material development and carbon neutral solutions to agriculture and forestry.`,

                where he investigated outage behavior of cooperative communications in wireless relay networks. In 2021, 
                he developed an IoT system for mine, where LIDAR and web camera detect each loaded truck and send data to server via internet 
                to show estimated load volume on dashboard. In 2022, he developed real-time multi-player virtual reality game via 5G for intervening
